# Environment Configuration for SSL Certificate Handling

To properly handle SSL certificate issues with your backend server, you need to create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://172.208.104.103:8080
REACT_APP_IGNORE_CERT_ERRORS=true
HTTPS=true
```

## Instructions:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the frontend-simple directory
2. Copy the variables above into the file
3. Restart your development server

This will configure your React app to:
- Use the specified HTTPS backend URL
- Bypass certificate validation for development purposes
- Use HTTPS for the frontend development server

To make this configuration apply for both development and production:

1. Create a `.env.development` file with the same variables for development
2. Create a `.env.production` file for production settings (without REACT_APP_IGNORE_CERT_ERRORS)

For production, you should properly configure SSL certificates rather than ignoring errors.
